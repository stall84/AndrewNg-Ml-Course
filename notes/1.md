## Supervised Learning

#### Description

- "Supervised learning (SL) is a paradigm in machine learning where input objects (for example, a vector of predictor variables) and a desired output value (also known as human-labeled supervisory signal) train a model. The training data is processed, building a function that maps new data on expected output values."

#### Definitions

- _Features_: Features are _'x1,x2,...' values_ . The dimensions of input data for _supervised_ learning.

- _Labels_: Outputs _Y_ . Job of ML algorithm is to map _Labels_ to _Features_

## Unsupervised Learning

#### Description

- Basically your leaning algorithm will attempt to make sense of inputs _x_ on it's own. Having no _y_ _labeling_ from a human.

#### Definitions

- _Clustering_: This is the algorithm used by Google News for instance to crawl news sites, and group together articles based on how close they cluster in subject matter.
