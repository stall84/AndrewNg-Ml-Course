## Basic Math For ML (Review and New)

#### Vectors

- In CS we can think of these as just a list of attributes on an object. In space they are magnitudes with direction (in a classic 2D sense). _Or better put in the physics/algebra since they are objects that move you around physical space._
- Consider the following example of a single house:

```
floor_space = 120m^2
bedrooms = 2
bathrooms = 1
price = 150,000

```

$\begin{bmatrix} 120 \\
2 \\
1 \\
150 \end{bmatrix}$
